                    <p>Hi. My name is Brooke, and I created Pickle Wagon to simply help people that wanted help. I made this so people could write about the reality of living with addiction in todays world. I worked in the substance abuse industry for a long time, and the deeper I got, the more horrific things were looking behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>I just wanted somewhere people to go to find a REAL opinion about this detox facility or that rehab, and readily have access to resources that had no monetary motive. For example, www.findtreatment.gov is one of the greatest websites I've ever seen for finding exactly the treatment you're looking for, yet no one has ever heard of it and if you google "find rehab near me" or something similar, all you get are ads for treatment that is either unaffordable or underfunded.</p>
                    <p>I can't do much about the flaws in the healthcare system, but I can make things a little easier for people, especially in the moments where any excuse to not get help will stop someone from getting help. Please feel free to reach out to me for suggestions, or if you just need a little more help.</p>

                        <img src="imgs/logo.png" alt="Web of Wyrd Symbol" class="logo">
                        <p>Our logo is the Nordic symbol "Web of Wyrd". The Web of Wyrd represents the interconnectedness of past, present, and future in Norse mythology. I felt it represented Pickle Wagon well, and felt this symbol was very meaningful since it symbolizes all of "the possibilities" that the past, present, and future brought and might bring.</p>
