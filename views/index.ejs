        <p>Pickle Wagon is a completely anonymous social media network for those of us that were once cucumbers and trying to stay on the wagon, or better yet get on the wagon. Here, you can post about your struggles, victories, good days, bad days, and everything in between. <br>Just get out of a horrible treatment facility? Tell us about it. Want to see if someone else had a bad time at the facility you're thinking about going to? Take a look at past discussions. <br> Think of this as a place to get some help and/or yell into the void.</p>
