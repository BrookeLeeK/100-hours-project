        <p>Pickle Wagon is a completely anonymous social network platform where you can post about your struggles, victories, good days, and bad days in sobriety. This site is not about judgment or advocacy for/against any type of substance use. It's simply an open space to talk about the experience of being sober after years of using. Think of this as a place to get some help and/or yell into the void.<br>Pickle Wagon is a community of people posting anonymously to share their thoughts, stories, and support. Posting in this community is completely anonymous; no one knows who you are or what your post was about. We will NEVER share your information with another party.</p>
