# Pickle Wagon


This is Pickle Wagon, an anonymous social media website for people in the sober community. Pickle Wagon is for posting about your life, creating discussions about facilities, and finding useful resources for getting help. Anonymously.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, and soon will include React.js

I created Pickle Wagon, a fullstack CRUD web application, using an MVC architecture. I'm using MongoDB/Mongoose for my database, and will be using netlify to host (temporarily). I've used cloudinary for images, and bootstrap for the styling. I will be adding react.js in the coming weeks to sharpen the efficiency and readability.



## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson learned while creating this monster is sometimes simpler is better. At first I wanted this to look and work like Facebook or Twitter, lots of bells and whistles with a *modern* design. Finally after many arguments with my computer screen, I started from scratch. I started over with my design, made sure the key features were simple and easy to use, and voila. I made something I'm very proud of, and at the end of the day I built this to help people. Before tech, I worked in the substance abuse field. I wanted to make a website that had at least a little bit of what I felt the industry was missing, aka honesty.
